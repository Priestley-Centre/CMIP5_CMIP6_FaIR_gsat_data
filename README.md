# CMIP5, CMIP6, and FaIR GSAT data

Time-series of annual global surface air temperature anomalies for the CMIP5 historical, RCP2.6, and RCP8.5 simulations, and for the CMIP6 historical, SSP1-2.6, and SSP5-8.5 simulations. Each time-series is for each model's ensemble mean, and anomalies are calculated with respect to the relevant model's pre-industrial control simulation. The data covers the period 1850-2100 for all models. Any missing data is indicated by a value of 999999, and masks are also provided.

The data in this repository was processed as part of the EU-funded CONSTRAIN project and this project should acknowledged by all users of this data. Processing was carried out on JASMIN from the raw CMIP5 and CMIP6 data stored in /badc/cmip5 and /badc/cmip6. The current models in the dataset are all of the models currently available on JASMIN as of 07/11/2019.
