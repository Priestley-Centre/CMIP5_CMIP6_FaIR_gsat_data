The data in this repository was processed with funding from the European Unionâ€™s CONSTRAIN project as part of the Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under grant agreement number 820829.

# CMIP5 and CMIP6 GSAT data

Time-series of annual global surface air temperature (GSAT) anomalies for the CMIP5 historical, RCP2.6, and RCP8.5 simulations, and for the CMIP6 historical, SSP1-2.6, and SSP5-8.5 simulations. Each time-series is for each model's ensemble mean, and anomalies are calculated with respect to the relevant model's pre-industrial control simulation. The data covers the period 1850-2100 for all models. Any missing data is indicated by a value of 999999, and masks are also provided.

Processing was carried out on JASMIN from the raw CMIP5 and CMIP6 data stored in /badc/cmip5 and /badc/cmip6. The current models in the dataset are all of the models currently available on JASMIN as of 07/11/2019. 

# FaIR GSAT data

Time-series of annual GSAT anomalies for 500 FaIR simple model historical, SSP1-2.6, and SSP5-8.5 simulations. The 500 simulations were generated from a broad uncertainty analysis of possible futures, based on lines of evidence for ECS, TCR, and radiative forcing updated from those used in similar analysis for IPCC SR1.5. Anomalies are calculated with respect to 1850-1900.

The figure 'plots_fair_median_timeseries.pdf' shows that while CMIP5 and CMIP6 employed slightly different emission scenarios, FaIR simulations suggest that this has a minimal effect on the projected CMIP6 and CMIP5 differences.
