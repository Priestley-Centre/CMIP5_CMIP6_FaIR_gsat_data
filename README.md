# CMIP6_gsat_data
Time-series of annual global surface air temperature anomalies for the CMIP6 historical, SSP1-2.6, and SSP5-8.5 simulations. Each time-series is for each model's ensemble mean, and anomalies are calculated with respect to the relevant model's pre-industrial control simulation. The data covers the period 1850-2100 for all models except CAMS-CSM1-0, where 2100 is missing (indicated by a value of 999999). 

The data in this repository was processed as part of the EU-funded CONSTRAIN project and this project should acknowledged by all users of this data. Processing was carried out on JASMIN from the raw CMIP6 data stored in /badc/cmip6. The current models in the dataset are all of the models currently available on JASMIN as of 07/11/2019.
